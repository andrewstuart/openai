# A go wrapper for OpenAI Platform APIs

This is a wrapper around OpenAI APIs that means to simplify the creation of
tooling that interacts with OpenAI and other Go code in fun, novel ways. There
is also a generic fun cli in `cmd/openai` that exposes library code to the CLI
as well as providing some usage examples for the library.

If you need a token, head over to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys,
and sign up if you need to. If you haven't signed up already, you usually get
$20ish in credit, which should get you pretty far.

You may also notice that there are plenty of pointers for optional fields in
Request structs, but none of the common helper funcs to return pointers. I
created one module to rule them all (there may be others, but it's 3 lines and I
honestly didn't want to spend the time looking). I suggest
[github.com/andrewstuart/p](https://github.com/andrewstuart/p) for your "pointer to anything, even a literal or
const" needs.

```bash
go install github.com/andrewstuart/openai/cmd/openai@latest

echo "token: $MY_TOKEN" >> $HOME/.config/openai.yaml
# Or export TOKEN in your environment variables.
# add org: <your org id> if you are a member of multiple organizations.
